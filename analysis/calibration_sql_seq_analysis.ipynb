    "## Initial observations\n",
    "- at higher confidence (>0.5)\n",
    "    - A common source of exact match error is a mismatch in quotation mark style (predicts \", reference has ')\n",
    "    - sometimes also missing semi-colon causes error \n",
    "    - Another common source: model not making use of info in the input context, e.g. over-riding table names, etc., hallucinating values (especially problems with countries and places e.g. \"Kanghanistan\" instead of \"Kabul\", \"Angolance\" instead of \"Angola\")\n",
    "    - background knowledge required (beyond what's in the prompt). For example, input \"What are the names of conductors who have conducted at more than one orchestra?\" has gold program that groups by conductor_id instead of conductor_name. That's probably a smarter thing to do, but conductor_name isn't necessarily wrong (unless multiple conductors have the same name). Without knowing more about the assumptions underlying the database, no way to say that this is definitively wrong. \n",
    "- at lower confidence (<0.5)\n",
    "   - seems like more straight up mistakes, seems like lots with overly-simple programs\n",
    "   - maybe more relative clauses/multi-hop queries in the input (\"What are the names of high schoolers who have likes, and how many likes does each have?\")\n",
